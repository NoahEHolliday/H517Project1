    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose for the visualization is to add a time dimension to recreation of Dr. John Snow's map of London's 1854 cholera epidemic. The original visualization was a map outlining the city with plots for water pumps and deaths from cholera. The result allowed the realization that the recent outbreak could be directly related to the water sanitation of the plotted pumps. This visualizations seeks to recreate this information with addition to a time slicer allowing the user to step forward and backward by day. 
        We are achieving this by using four distinct data sets. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.	streets.json - that is allowing us to make the outline of the surrounding area for the outbreak. </li>
            <li>2.	pumps.csv - gives the coordinates for the pumps</li>
            <li>3.	deathdays.csv - gives the day and how many people died</li>
            <li>4.	deaths_age_sex.csv - gives age, gender, and location of victim. List is in order with the first casualty being the first record in the table. </li>
        </ul>
